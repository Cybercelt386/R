## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Using multiple linear regression I created the model with miles per Gallon (MPG) as the dependant variable and tested the P_values and R-squared values. 

After fitting the model I ran a summary command on the model the following sumary statistics were produced.

the p-value is 5.35e-11 

vehicle length, ground clearance, and vehicle weight(if threshold is 0.7149)
